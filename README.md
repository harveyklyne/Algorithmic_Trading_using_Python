# Algorithmic Trading using Python

I am following FreeCodeCamp's "Algorithmic Trading using Python" course. The course covers:
1) Equal-weight S&P 500 portfolio.
2) Momentum strategy.
3) Value strategy.

Here I modify (1) to be market-capitalization-weighted.
I have access to an API for randomized US stock market data, so this does not reflect accurate prices and I cannot
use FTSE stocks.
